**sci fi poem**
```
 ,
 spontaneous is my grasp on a world endless-  ,
 we seek things to fill the hole  ,
 we bit the apple, instead of being seeded  ,
     of the angle of starting worked out in the sequel.  ,
     in the form for the tension, and this is sufficient  ,
 spring flowers, autumnâ€™s riot till winter comes;  ,
 magellan, perhaps not the first to sail around the globe  ,
   , the little shining light is enough to set us free.  ,
 even this lowly creature up out of the pen  ,
 see time trace a new beat,  ,
     in working the problem the first thing of course is  ,
   sometimes we are afraid to walk alone in the dark,  ,
    shining its powerful light it never forgets,  ,
 of  fractals or measurement,  ,
 imaginative and sorrowful, and even at times sci-fi.  ,
     the chain undergoes a distorting convulsion,  ,
     the chain undergoes a distorting convulsion,  ,
 a singularity of beauty are you  , ,
```
**evil poem**
```
ancients wings of death are wrapped around me  ,
 ashtart, ashtart the fire son  ,
 blasphemy  ,
 summoning ancient gods  ,
 serving satan and his demons for the heathen rise.  ,
 on this night of a mystic moon...  ,
 unholy rites of blood and knives  ,
 unholy victory!!!  ,
 black magic force takes it's course  ,
 bring the final hour  ,
 shadows covering temples of doom.  ,
 blood and flesh we shed with might.  ,
 fell the knife slice through your life!  ,
```
**gore poem**
```

the rotten  ,
 you'll get more strength  ,
 i open up the coffin  ,
 icons shatter with burning holes  ,
 arriving from beyond  ,
 worms  ,
 out from the chambers  ,
 cometh the rightful kings of the highest halls  ,
 nose sewn to an upper leg  ,
 for the lights  ,
 buried dead i've spiritually infected  ,
 decaying bodies left unburied  ,
 blood explodes from every hole  ,
 a thousand ways to kill  ,
 coming of flood  ,
 virgin, untouched skin  , ,
```
**viking poem**
```
the and summon gods by sacrifice in blood  ,
 one we were scum of the earth  ,
 came charging down the beach  ,
 marching down the left hand path  ,
 attacking us in the mid-day sun  ,
 the truth unfolds  ,
 then i knew that my life was saved  ,
 though spears may spare his life  ,
 consumed by my hate  ,
 we'll never bend untill the end  ,
 i'll stand my ground!  ,
 on these southern battlefields  ,
 i won't play the well-adjusted role  ,
 i engrave the blade with magic runes  ,
 so death finally came to him  ,  ,
```
**love poem**
```
and then face a new voice with openness of mind  ,
 humble my heart, feelings aside,  ,
 our bodies entwined  ,
 if fire starts all love  ,
 help me not to make assumptions,  ,
 i had no emotions and no love to provide  ,
 to unlock the songs and melodies.  ,
 and shares all joys and sorrows.  ,
 there is nothing left.  ,
 love is there, i thought, in our care  ,
 let them match in your love through all i say and do,  
 don't leave me alone  ,
```
