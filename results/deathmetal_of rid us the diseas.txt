of rid us the disease of mankind  ,
 one of them ripped off all my clothes  ,
 towards the frost moon eclipse  ,
 it has begun  ,
 dirty fucking slut who deserves to suffer  ,
 down to anus  ,
 total evil  ,
 nothing will survive  ,
 i sucked like a whore while i was assfucked by elephant trunk  ,
 fight my thoughts - my own thoughts  ,
 all your prayers weren't worth much  ,
 will bring him back to earth  ,
 rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding  ,
 uncover carnage within, split wide open  ,
 something happened when i snapped a picture  ,
