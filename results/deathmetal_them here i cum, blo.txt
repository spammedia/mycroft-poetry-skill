them here i cum, blood gushes from  ,
 torn from your life reborn  ,
 i'm just waiting for decay  ,
 join my yearning emptiness  ,
 the vision of destruction  ,
 flames, wildfire  ,
 warrior of hell  ,
 nothing can save the earth  ,
 the cause of world-wide homicide  ,
 it is so cute, i want to fuck it hard  ,
 breeding ignorance  ,
 crudely tied to wrists and ankles  ,
 i will explore, the body wide open  ,
 of all those who were slain, all return  ,
 the touch of velvet rubbed against my soul  ,
 fucking the rotting  ,
 your lives he will take  ,
