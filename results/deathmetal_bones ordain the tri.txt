bones ordain the triumph of salvation  ,
 i can smell the pain of death  ,
 cutting off an ear to eat  ,
 a flock of vultures approach while blotting out the sun  ,
 from earlier centuries  ,
 intercourse with infants  ,
 thoughts of things you've always known  ,
 you must come to me  ,
 slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay  ,
 in storm i stand upon the ruins  ,
 newborn die  ,
