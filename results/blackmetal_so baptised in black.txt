so baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar  ,
 roaming through the lonely forest casting evil spells to the sacred heavens of the gods that we must destroy.  ,
 star in the night sky, brightest of all stars  ,
 baphomet raise your horns, pierce the heavens, make them bleed...  ,
 drips from the altar  ,
 immortals breed hate  ,
 brothers of shadows, those of the cult...  ,
 burning in hell's fire  ,
 burning children for my god  ,
 in the name of satan, lucifer and baal  ,
 suicide in lonesome lands of endless.  ,
 pray that god's desceased  ,
 i am embraced by the cosmic force of night.  ,
