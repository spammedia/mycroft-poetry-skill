for something happened when i snapped a picture  ,
 a painful end  ,
 hatred for all fucking life  ,
 shine for me fields of sorrow  ,
 still breathing  ,
 necropedophile  ,
 and thereâ€™s no difference between ravens  ,
 on you  ,
 not 'til they die and rot up  ,
 no one will discover the murder they commit  ,
