satan i shall fade away in the fire realm below...  ,
 virgin screams out in fright!  ,
 pagan victory  ,
 oh! death is near, take me now lord of shadows...  ,
 elements of nature grant us wisdom, domination, power and control.  ,
 massacre the holy ones again and again  ,
 storming through the heavens  ,
 shamdon, shamdon the evil one  ,
 hail to the true, intense vampires  ,
 you are my ruler, lead me to your throne  ,
 realm of satan's shadows are the sounds of tortured souls.  ,
 "my blood is yours king of mine... lucifer".  ,
 we deny any god of feeble faith  ,
 wars in cosmic battlefields is the answer to my call,  ,
 offering dripping fat and blood.  ,
