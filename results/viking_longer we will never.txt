longer we will never  ,
 will pierce their bodies in battle  ,
 this is the ride for vengeance!"  ,
 they leave this land  ,
 feel the pain  ,
 we'll make their suffering short  ,
 ragnar√∂k awaits  ,
 he pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip  ,
 a bear-coated man stands in the bow  ,
 let your weapons slash and tear  ,
 i die!  ,
