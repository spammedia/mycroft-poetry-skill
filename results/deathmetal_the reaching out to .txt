the reaching out to snatch the next  ,
 down her throat, swallow  ,
 of all those who're alive, not an animal - not a man  ,
 lifeless body, slouching dead  ,
 arm yourself with the right to kill at will  ,
 at one with my sixth sense, i feel free  ,
 the murderers  ,
 the pigs the want to lock me up  ,
 so, stand and fight or kill yourself right now  ,
 shine for me dread moon  ,
 i'll take away your life  ,
 from  ,
