sky to disprove what the bible has to say  ,
 we seek things to fill the hole  ,
 not even my reason can get out,  ,
 only to become a dye of red.  ,
 as mankind drifts further from his soul  ,
 we are now so smart we don't use our brain  ,
     if then you reduce to the tangent and normal,  ,
 what was there before that?  ,
 across the catacombs and canyons of  ,
 as if a vole in the garden  ,
 and what made the nothing i pray?  ,
 our quest for knowledge has drove us insane  ,
