appearing crawling - roaches  
 family now complete  
 i bleed, the blood of the dead  
 gun to the head  
 murder mankind murder mankind  
 the horizon will be open for me  
 i hear her voice aliing  
 as mother dismembers  
 kill  
 and to fenris the earth to quell  
 i'll kill `til i die  
 mighty were the fathers of norse men  
 evil  
 pleague of zombies  
 now... that all his enemies have ceased  
 curl up and die  
 creations of ice shall behold
