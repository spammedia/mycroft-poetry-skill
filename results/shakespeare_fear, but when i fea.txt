fear, but when i fear'd i was a loyal wife: 
 whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red, 
 to clip elysium and to lack her joy. 
 guilty of treason, forgery, and shift, 
 fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting! 
 though i were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee; 
 what recketh he his rider's angry stir, 
 who, wondering at him, did his words allow: 
 'what have you urged that i cannot reprove? 
 as bound in knighthood to her imposition, 
 when he did frown, o, had she then gave over, 
 ere long espied a fickle maid full pale, 5 
 do tell her she is dreadfully beset, 495 
 and leave this idle theme, this bootless chat: 
 the bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd 1165 
 that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks. 
 with her the horse, and left adonis there: 
 that done, despitefully i mean to bear thee 
 to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
