that this is a battle that will never have an end  ,
 red eyes looking inside...black stars  ,
 and fill the chalice  ,
 infinite spells of hate i cast from my moon throne.  ,
 bays from the moon cabby my words  ,
 summoning the ancients of doom  ,
 destroy holy skies for the end of light  ,
 forever i shall be loyal to thee  ,
 chanting under skies of titan moons  ,
 black magic force takes it's course  ,
 lord of wickedness we summon you shedding  ,
 lord of nature i worship thee.  ,
 i will breathe my fire towards the cosmic eye.  ,
 stand high knowledged ones  ,
 mist of doom will consume!  ,
 they turn the other cheek and we give them death  ,
