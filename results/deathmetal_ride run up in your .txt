ride run up in your house with a tek out  ,
 born without arms and legs  ,
 face the pain - let it become part of you  ,
 you will come alive  ,
 it's time for the final feast  ,
 the reaper took the heaven sent  ,
 death seeks the light and then it just engulfs it  ,
 i can smell the pain of death  ,
 sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect  ,
 slimy rectum, full of rot and shit  ,
 from  ,
 father watches on  ,
 losing half  ,
 on dead angels demons dance  ,
 soon you'll all be dead - all  ,
