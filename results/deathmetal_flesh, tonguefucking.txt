flesh, tonguefucking putrefying cunt  
 desecrate  
 the last one's for me  
 the throne of the frozen kingdom  
 and from the beaten lands  
 the ancient gods reclaim the earth  
 i can't control my own thought  
 tear the flesh of the remains of mankind  
 turning  
 now your guts drool out my mouth  
 i fuck like a rabbid, cat screams in agony  
 now your guts drool out my mouth  
 time of humans end  
 maggots crawling, insects feasting  
 her head disconnected  
 in which i shall be gone  
 strapped to the table  
 in the under dark
