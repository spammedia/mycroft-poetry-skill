my shadows covering temples of doom.  ,
 deadly night...  ,
 far below the black soiled earth, thrones of fire await  ,
 marked with your claw, chalice fills with blood.  ,
 far below the black soiled earth, thrones of fire await  ,
 gathered in the ancient woodlands  ,
 gargoyle of hell fucking eats the dead!  ,
 standing within a pentagram.  ,
 oh, hate living...the only heat is warm blood  ,
 rise... sounds of war  ,
 blasphemy  ,
 many christians killed!  ,
 fire burns!  ,
 on thy goat head with wicked horns.  ,
 rise from the ashes!  ,
