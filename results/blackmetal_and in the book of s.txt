and in the book of shadows i will now remain  ,
 ancient words are spoken as the rite begins  ,
 this is a battle that will never have an end  ,
 soldiers dressed in black waving banners of the horde.  ,
 far beyond the end of space  ,
 i tear the flesh off the face of god  ,
 throne of torment horns of hell  ,
 cast your unholy dark spells to me  ,
 speak to me master, teach me your secrets  ,
 conflict of evil reigns unholy  ,
 fire now ignites the skies.  ,
 child, victim of mine, now your time has arrived, lay now on the altar and perish in eternal fire from hell fire from baal, burning as the solar gods consume your flesh from earth and the sea summoning the ancient king of death ritually offering sweet blood.  ,
 storming through the heavens  ,
 feeling the weak and enshrouded, shall i remain in grieving,  ,
 stand high knowledged ones  ,
 star in the night sky, brightest of all stars  ,
 and cutting off the head of every jewisch christian pig  ,
