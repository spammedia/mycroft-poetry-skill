of eternal black thrones await  ,
 far below the black soiled earth, thrones of fire await  ,
 grant us your powers of annihilation  ,
 unholy rites of blood and knives  ,
 cutting into my own flesh...  ,
 lord of all death  ,
 descend to forgotten lands  ,
 abbadon, the ancient god of destruction and all death...  ,
 satan, in the night we summan thee,  ,
 oh! ancient rite on this night of a full moon!  ,
 far beyond the end of space  ,
 ancient times  ,
 stars that hide  ,
