the i call upon gods of destruction, war and revege for the end of sacred  ,
 focus satan's power!  ,
 altar calls my name; i shall summon my own death  ,
 blasphemy  ,
 the arrows of moderation failed to hit me  ,
 dark unholy forces flocking it's black wings to our hidden temple  ,
 with these words i chant...  ,
 master of shadows, ruler of hell.  ,
 burn with pride the holy throne...  ,
 gathered in the ancient woodlands  ,
 unholy victory!!!  ,
 holy throne in ashes  ,
 i raise the torches flaming high above  ,
 i am the one summoning the mighty war god  ,
 baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar  ,
 sacrifice  ,
 storming through the heavens  ,
 open seven gates  ,
