infernal we are the soldiers of infernal war  ,
 moan bleeding... die weeping...  ,
 hell's fire burning desecrating valley  ,
 flaming torch of knowledge burns  ,
 more ancient than time i am for i have no life of flesh...  ,
 cryptic goat horns within...black stars  ,
 to be draped by the shadow of your morbid palace  ,
 give me the power  ,
 gathered in a magic circle singing ancient hymns  ,
 crush, crush, crush... jesus  ,
