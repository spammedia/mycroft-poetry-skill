ride i seek to end my life  ,
 and i smile, cause it makes me...  ,
 so comes llodyns noble son  ,
 don't despair, show no fear  ,
 here they come so raise the shields high  ,
 will burn forever more  ,
 the southern sphere is set ablaze  ,
 robbed of arms, robbed of pride  ,
 so i die  ,
 dark skies above us  ,
 christian state will meet its fate  ,
 with every step i take  ,
 nidhoggs tearing corpses  ,
 gods of war arise!  ,
 in strange and foreign tongues  ,
