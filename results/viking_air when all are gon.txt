air when all are gone  ,
 a feast awaits until the next day  ,
 and just before the preacher dies  ,
 we return on bloody seas  ,
 and one hundred men prepared for war  ,
 with sharp blades in mighty fists  ,
 the warming sun returns again  ,
 many nights pass  ,
 and though i've spilled a lot of blood  ,
 whatever death awaits!  ,
 and yggdrasil quakes  ,
 keeping my sword concealed  ,
 why cannot death just set me free!  ,
 boldley charging the enemy lines  ,
 i'll stand my ground!  ,
 won't feel the breeze of my home shore  ,
 his wrath burns!  ,
