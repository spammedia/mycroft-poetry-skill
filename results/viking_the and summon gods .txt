the and summon gods by sacrifice in blood  ,
 one we were scum of the earth  ,
 came charging down the beach  ,
 marching down the left hand path  ,
 attacking us in the mid-day sun  ,
 the truth unfolds  ,
 then i knew that my life was saved  ,
 though spears may spare his life  ,
 consumed by my hate  ,
 we'll never bend untill the end  ,
 i'll stand my ground!  ,
 on these southern battlefields  ,
 i won't play the well-adjusted role  ,
 i engrave the blade with magic runes  ,
 so death finally came to him  ,
