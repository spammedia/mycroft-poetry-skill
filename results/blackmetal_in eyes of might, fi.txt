in eyes of might, fire so brigth, black sky lighten from the evil horned moon.  ,
 is the one that is asking that we answer his wish  ,
 to the moon, cosmic throne of the sky i sing songs of death as i cut infant flesh deeply.  ,
 ancient times  ,
 fly through stars of red fire, i fly beyond light.  ,
 invoking solitary demons  ,
 flood the temple the witches spell!  ,
 give me the strength  ,
 kingdom of torture is my domain.  ,
 careful..pale...forever at night  ,
