life it feels like spikes  ,
 all are gone  ,
 we'd never lost a fight in war  ,
 waits a life in slavery  ,
 in their eyes is no remorse  ,
 no christian woman unraped  ,
 in this fight of iron wills  ,
 dripping  ,
 blasphemer of gods above  ,
 it's what the vala has foreseen  ,
 out of the night  ,
 today is the day that i die  ,
 lost in a dreadful dream i'll meet my fate  ,
 like the bear attacks its prey  ,
 row for all your worth!  ,
 nowhere to hide  ,
 a bolt of lightning bright  ,
 the pagan man could not be turned  ,
