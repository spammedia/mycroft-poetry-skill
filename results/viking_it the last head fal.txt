it the last head falls to the ground  ,
 hear the pounding thunder hooves  ,
 as twilight falls and the stars come forth  ,
 extinction waits for everyone  ,
 my dreams began to fade  ,
 and put your faith in deceitful words  ,
 the irish fell to our wrath  ,
 i know that oden's sent for me  ,
 a bloodshed like no one has seen here before  ,
 truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged  ,
 the ships bring terror to these shores  ,
