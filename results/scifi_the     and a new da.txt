the     and a new dance starts.  ,
 flew through galaxies beyond earth’s sky  ,
     in the time a t totum would take to revolve.  ,
 i am the beginning and the ending of stories told  ,
 our planet, our world.  ,
 i am no longer with the time-space continuum,  ,
 the man you really need to know,  ,
 “discoverers” reinvented the forgotten ship’s wheel  ,
 in the shadow of phobos and deimos  ,
 darkness fills the air, the moon gives light with every care.  ,
 about the universe and how miracles unfold  ,
 riddled in radiation  ,
 and all the stars...  ,
 toward a rush of serendipity ...  ,
     you may turn it and twist it the dons to amuse.  ,
 in the shadow of phobos and deimos  ,
  all the animals of the sea, come forth creating a musical harmony.  ,
