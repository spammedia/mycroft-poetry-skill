would words now groove clear passage.  ,
 to put them in their place.  ,
 the analog ascension and the direct connection to spirit  ,
 a modicum of grace  ,
 life once flowed in seas, fossils found  ,
 through speaking my thoughts into existence  ,
 nebulas, as space moves out of reach  ,
 the cydonia region of mars  ,
 i often reflect on mankind's plight  ,
 solo would envy. faster than him, i'd be.  ,
 a page from sci-fi novels ripped  ,
 this is major tom to ground control, i'm stepping through the door  ,
 into each otherâ€™s eyes more,  ,
 take off flying high in a pinkish-red  ,
     atoms with consciousness  ,
