to undaunted i just write and write impromptu-  ,
 into each other’s eyes more,  ,
 upon buried capacitor fates  ,
 are relatively rare in the polar regions.  ,
 admiral byrd not the first man to visit the south pole  ,
 where pyramids are unexplained  ,
 when the red planet’s oceans dried  ,
 i am constant energy  ,
 which roost and reproduce up north  ,
 i am no longer with the time-space continuum,  ,
