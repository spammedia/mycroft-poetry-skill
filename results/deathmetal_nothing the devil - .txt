nothing the devil - made me want it  ,
 i cant't wait to fell the pain  ,
 from earlier centuries  ,
 in everyway the grim death has now found you  ,
 holes appearing  ,
 suddenly i woke up, it was only a dream  ,
 body buried in a shallow grave  ,
 strapped to the table  ,
 serging serum  ,
 on our way to the next place to murder at  ,
 encircle thee  ,
 will bring him back to earth  ,
 sold as porn in 666 postages  ,
 i was at one with a blackening moonlit  ,
 forever captured in the dark  ,
