than deep under moon skies far in a forest,  
 members of infernal worship gather in the night,  
 imperial prince  
 attack with might  
 has now been opened!  
 i chant the pagan hymns.  
 gathered in a magic circle singing ancient hymns  
 i renounce the god of the christian faith  
 burning children for my god  
 altar calls my name; i shall summon my own death  
 summoning the demons of the sea.  
 you are my fire  
 loyal i shall be...  
 army of christians...  
 hail... abaddon
