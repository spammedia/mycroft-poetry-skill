spine tattered are my memories bittersweet,  ,
 a sphinx left behind as a sign  ,
 and sixty-seven words, per day.  ,
 see time trace a new beat,  ,
 and i'm floating in a most peculiar way  ,
 we can now place a robot up on mars  ,
  this is ground control to major tom, you've really made the grade  ,
 ares and olympus mons...  ,
 oh please! oh please i beg! bring forth to me.  ,
 on skin symbolic  ,
 shrink down to atomic scale  ,
