in fly through stars of red fire, i fly beyond light.  ,
 and those who spelled death are so ready  ,
 with unholy words  ,
 dean, dead, satan i am dead...  ,
 fire and water, earth and all air.  ,
 i summon deities of hate through unholy magic spells.  ,
 open wide gates of hell! show me death with your fire!  ,
 knife in my hand, axe in the other  ,
 sacrifice! sacrifice! kill the child in the night.  ,
 reigning ancient ways  ,
 centuires of gore, bloody lakes of red  ,
