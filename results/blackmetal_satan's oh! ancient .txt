satan's oh! ancient rite on this night of a full moon!  
 offering dripping fat and blood.  
 far inside our temple black candles burn  
 the mountains are cold...soul...soul...  
 i chant the pagan hymns.  
 worshiping the pagan gods of unholy war in the darkest caves of ancient lands that inspire gloom.  
 oh! lord of mine  
 we are the sons of a true god, mighty creator of our race.  
 i bow before thee  
 i raise my torch and worship thee  
 so unreal but true  
 king of all kings i swear to thee  
 sad and cold as i hear crypt sounds of moan.  
 deep inside the forest  
 altar calls my name; i shall summon my own death  
 lord of wickedness we summon you shedding  
 ceremonies of the heathens, deep inside a mystic temple.  
 drips from the altar
