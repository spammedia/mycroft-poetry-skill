becomes on dead angels demons dance  ,
 one that has never been  ,
 bastard son of god  ,
 everyday i can hear voices in my head  ,
 with disdain now crush this divinity  ,
 and the end begins  ,
 infernal death, a world in flames  ,
 im lurking in the shadows with my axe  ,
 killing all in sight  ,
 master of nebulah frost  ,
 wide open pussy in front of me  ,
 my limbs  ,
