offspring, grace in all simplicity,  
 was melted like a vapour from her sight,  
 authority for sin, warrant for blame,  
 which like a cherubin above them hover'd.  
 but if the like the snow-white swan desire,  
 sorrow changed to solace, solace mix'd with sorrow;  
 so white a friend engirts so white a foe:  
 he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute  
 distempering gentle love in his desire,  
 till they might open to adorn the day. 450  
 for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee: 565  
 and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,
