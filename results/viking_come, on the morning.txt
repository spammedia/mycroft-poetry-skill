come, on the morning of the fifth day  ,
 the enemies lay ahead!  ,
 now is when heroes are born  ,
 slashing  ,
 in the name of whatever god  ,
 massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released  ,
 and hateful burning yes  ,
 of remorse in their eyes  ,
 no time for lament  ,
 into the great hall  ,
 from morning mist  ,
