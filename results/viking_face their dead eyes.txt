face their dead eyes look to the sky  ,
 nothing can stop this final attack  ,
 soon a new day will be spawned  ,
 and as the swordplay rambles on  ,
 and now i'm doomed  ,
 the day that all things living die  ,
 truth to you are lies to me  ,
 order needs its anarchy  ,
 he then devoured gullveig's heart  ,
 silence before the storm  ,
 no one survives  ,
 you feel weak and scared  ,
