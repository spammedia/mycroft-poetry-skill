door and vengeance is  ,
 boldley charging the enemy lines  ,
 this is my sword  ,
 my one and only choice was to flee this land  ,
 and all i have is hate inside  ,
 passing just above my head  ,
 still i fought on.  ,
 home shore calls  ,
 with laufey's son on board  ,
 blood is shed  ,
 at the edge of the world  ,
 they cannot be quelled  ,
 like a hot knife cuts through snow.  ,
 and no one can believe  ,
 cast down war and endless pain  ,
