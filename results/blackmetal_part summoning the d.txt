part summoning the demons in the name of satan...  ,
 hail... beelzebub  ,
 "in the name of satan, lucifer and all demons of the infernal cult...  ,
 shadows covering temples of doom.  ,
 speak to me master, teach me your secrets  ,
 winds of death, thrones of black  ,
 infinite i am an endless  ,
 i renounce the god of the christian faith  ,
 fell the knife slice through your life!  ,
 winds of fire; burn flames of satan's realm  ,
 sacrifice  ,
 killing on the pentagram draining all the blood  ,
 wings of death are wrapped around me  ,
 standing within a pentagram.  ,
 i am the one that summons thee... lord of the night, master of death.  ,
 mighty king of kings.  ,
 careful..pale...forever at night  ,
