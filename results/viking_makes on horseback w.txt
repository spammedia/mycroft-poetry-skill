makes on horseback with their spears  ,
 of lies that hold you down  ,
 and with oden on our side  ,
 they made us face the brutal truth  ,
 on the soft muddy ground  ,
 i fall to my knees.  ,
 no sword has ever been like this one  ,
 death of my foe  ,
 don't despair, show no fear  ,
 they will make them kneel  ,
