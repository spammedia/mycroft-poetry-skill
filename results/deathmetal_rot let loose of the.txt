rot let loose of the anger, held back too long  ,
 he is the nova that will drape the sky in woe  ,
 to soar into the deepest gorge  ,
 those who won't turn - meat!  ,
 the creatures of the dead will arise  ,
 to the elder ravens  ,
 in memorial to the one with pride  ,
 salvation's now a dead infection  ,
 your death has arrived  ,
 roots of pestilent plague  ,
