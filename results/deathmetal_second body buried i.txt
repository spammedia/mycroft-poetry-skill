second body buried in a shallow grave  ,
 those i hunt are  ,
 the taste is incredible, much better than the one that is alive  ,
 peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon  ,
 i hear the voice of every child  ,
 so, stand and fight or kill yourself right now  ,
 your eyes are frozen in a stare  ,
 terrifying death  ,
 we trample bejeweled thrones of the earth  ,
 i squirt my load allover her ass  ,
 moonrise fields of sorrow  ,
 views that eyes can never bear  ,
 will fall and never rise  ,
 violence is now a way of life  ,
 on a frosty path to sorrow  ,
 holes are oozing  ,
 always got one bullet left  ,
 i cut off its tail and shove it up my ass  ,
