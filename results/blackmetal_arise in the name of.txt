arise in the name of satan, lucifer and baal  
 black priest speaks  
 burning children for my god  
 i am the one summoning the mighty war god  
 in my empire of solitary death.  
 oh!! master grant me your power  
 gathered in a magic circle singing ancient hymns  
 baphomet raise your horns, pierce the lambs, make them bleed...  
 virgin screams out in fright!  
 embrace me eternally in your daylight slumber  
 hail satan king of kings
