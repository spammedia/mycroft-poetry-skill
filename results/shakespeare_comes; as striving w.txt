comes; as striving who should best become her grief; 990  ,
 and yet she hears no tidings of her love:  ,
 till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,  ,
 for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds? 1875  ,
 but i alone alone must sit and pine,  ,
 soft pity enters at an iron gate.  ,
 and govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.  ,
 towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,  ,
 that, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.  ,
 by how much of me their reproach contains. 190  ,
