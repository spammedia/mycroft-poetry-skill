of a pain so true yet so unreal  ,
 protector of mankind  ,
 feel the pain  ,
 we kept our given word  ,
 consumed by my hate  ,
 it's a golden bridge shines in the dark  ,
 you can't put me in chains  ,
 glancing across the fields of tyr  ,
 here they come, by oden sent  ,
 they show their sharp  ,
 the chains of lies will break  ,
 here comes the - bloodshed  ,
 we stand glorious!  ,
