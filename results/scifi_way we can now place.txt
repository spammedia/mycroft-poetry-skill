way we can now place a robot up on mars  ,
 are the unqualified barkings of puisine procrastination.  ,
 face the face that lines treat.  ,
 surviving nations lost their skill when history turned a page  ,
 words now groove clear passage.  ,
 to think, itâ€™s nasa's best kept secret  ,
 ancient seafarers drew with astounding accuracy  ,
 it's like something from a sci-fi movie but  ,
 where pyramids are unexplained  ,
  in an effort to get people to look  ,
 is even deeper then we first believed,  ,
 torches, candles, lighthouses, limelight, and electricity  ,
 space a scarf collapsed upon  ,
 a place all our elements may inhabit  ,
 surviving nations lost their skill when history turned a page  ,
 unabbreviated oxygen rhapsodies  ,
 precious pavonine pearl  ,
     if then you reduce to the tangent and normal,  ,
 even in the matrix, i'd get my kicks.  ,
