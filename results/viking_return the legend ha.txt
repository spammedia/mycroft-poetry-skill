return the legend has come  ,
 one thousand burning arrows  ,
 awaiting all that fought in wrath  ,
 through the blind they clearly hear  ,
 to finally break myself free  ,
 i bide my time  ,
 five horsemen in armour bright  ,
 king olaf threw his sword  ,
 one thousand years of lies  ,
 the fight was short and deadly intense  ,
 the brotherhood is gathered  ,
 we rage in our hearts burning bright  ,
 for a thousand years  ,
 we have held out for months  ,
 the headless body lays gently down  ,
 warlords invade with axe and blade  ,
 biting frost in the air  ,
 draw your swords to strike  ,
