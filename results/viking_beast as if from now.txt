beast as if from nowhere  ,
 death, odin hurled his spear off with great force  ,
 now they'll taste our bitter hate  ,
 of burning eyes  ,
 and the thousand years of tyranny will be forever gone  ,
 in kindness' name you spilled our blood  ,
 fallen men lie all around  ,
 vingtor sends the giant snake  ,
 the air is full of a thick  ,
 by heavens breath on wings of death  ,
 the great world tree yggdrasil  ,
 and dark are they  ,
 council of the now condemned  ,
 to bring down asgaard's mighty walls  ,
 they ride across the planes  ,
 and see my family get killed  ,
 this may be our last quest  ,
