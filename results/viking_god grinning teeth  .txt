god grinning teeth  ,
 is driving me insane  ,
 murderers, miscreants  ,
 all remorse i had has died  ,
 as if from nowhere  ,
 the icy winter is creeping near  ,
 "save us, oh lord, from the wrath of the norseman"  ,
 as well as their eyes  ,
 we make them kneel  ,
 arise to be free again  ,
 the one-eyed sits in glory might  ,
 the flames are raging higher  ,
 by his side with weapons drawn  ,
 the flames are raging higher  ,
