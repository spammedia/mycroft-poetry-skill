of yet i continue attempting to share some truth  ,
 late at night, i call my long distance lover,  ,
     each stupidly minding its own business…  ,
 on heaven’s destined oracle?  ,
     in the time a t totum would take to revolve.  ,
 i’ve been  to the park to watch the lovers’ kissing scene.  ,
 nebulas, as space moves out of reach  ,
 and when it ascends in the dawn burning dew  ,
 it is very real, as real as aliens are...  ,
 take off flying high in a pinkish-red  ,
   shadows before the eye can see  ,
 illusions can shatter;  ,
 oh, my darling where have you been?  ,
 i'd fire my laser. wield my light saber.  ,
 we had a lot to figure out  ,
  if in the sun we have beginnings,  ,
 guarded by schrödinger's cat  ,
 through speaking my thoughts into existence  ,
