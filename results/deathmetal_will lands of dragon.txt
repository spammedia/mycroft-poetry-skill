will lands of dragon birth  ,
 sing your songs with dying breath  ,
 and i cut out the vagina  ,
 sick and twisted  ,
 there's eternity for sale  ,
 as i slice your perinium  ,
 to kill repeatedly - your will not be found at all  ,
 warrior of hell  ,
 take the pain  ,
 in circles concentric against the earth  ,
 to trample bejeweled thrones of the earth  ,
 killing all in sight  ,
 that lies next to me decayed  ,
