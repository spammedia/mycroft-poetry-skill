the like a pig feeding off it's own shit, sick!  ,
 and the end begins  ,
 the armageddon  ,
 drink my marrow and blood for dessert  ,
 rules the hellish sites of death  ,
 creations of ice shall behold  ,
 we just want to know.  ,
 sawed-off, blow guts all over your bitch  ,
 emptied of your weakened soul  ,
 the ground is shaking, the end is near  ,
 off cane your head  ,
 not every single one of us is gonna last  ,
 a world that's free from pain  ,
 i felt like i was in heaven  ,
 witness the horror  ,
 descending now towards  ,
 yet not the only one  ,
 i can't control my own thoughts  ,
 hill  ,
