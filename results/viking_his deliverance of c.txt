his deliverance of certain death  ,
 moral preached by immoral fucks  ,
 and they never return in shame  ,
 he smells the fear and pain  ,
 unleash hell! do not repent!  ,
 sacrifice in blood  ,
 with a sword in each hand, soon he will fall  ,
 and the rhythm of the oars.  ,
 i will be their world's demise.  ,
 all the world shall know our bravery!  ,
