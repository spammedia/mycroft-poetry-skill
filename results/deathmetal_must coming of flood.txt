must coming of flood  ,
 sucking out the bloodied milk  ,
 descending now towards  ,
 disguised as the one to be  ,
 tainted blood rushes through veins  ,
 anal carving  ,
 reclaiming the loss of meat stolen from their bodies  ,
 i can't control my own thoughts  ,
 it's something i believe in  ,
 you motherfuckin critic-ass bitch motherfuckers  ,
 hell moves into paradise  ,
 with shadowed faces for the coming centuries  ,
 emptied of your weakened soul  ,
 young and helpless  ,
 life... awaiting signs from the one  ,
 for i saw them march  ,
