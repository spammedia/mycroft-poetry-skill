the a story made for divine fulfillment 
 flaming pagan fire burning high at night 
 baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar 
 you are my ruler, lead me to your throne 
 victory is in the fire 
 descend to forgotten lands 
 far beyond the end of space 
 invocvation chanted standing in a circle 
 i cut my flesh; slash my neck and my wrist. 
 "worship - satan - worship" 
 far below the black soiled earth, thrones of fire await 
 battlefields in churches is a vision we all have
