behold infernal gods of death bless thy sons of satan  ,
 wisdom of darkness lies in the shadows  ,
 then was the sent from hell  ,
 of hell from belial's cult.  ,
 spreading the unholy to villages near and far  ,
 immortality i seek.  ,
 open gates of hell  ,
 winds of fire; flames of satan's realm  ,
 sell inflicted wounds for my lord of hell  ,
 thunder bolts in the skies of fire burning heavens's realm of gold,  ,
 massacre the holy ones again and again  ,
