view just like the dinosaurs gave way  ,
 every new ability learned and created teaches me,  ,
 and i'm floating in a most peculiar way  ,
 we dream of gold from lead and mercury  ,
 lessons in life and i see my beautiful,  ,
     pleasure to estimate ds’s curvature.  ,
 tone over tone, a simplistic harmony  ,
 hold clues to human ancestry  ,
 where pyramids are unexplained  ,
 lanthanides and actinides  ,
 is not glued to a screen!  ,
     …yet forming white surf in unison.  ,
 is even deeper then we first believed,  ,
     …yet forming white surf in unison.  ,
     must equal the element’s mass into vt.  ,
 i have no reason,  ,,
