Shine

Life is something we all share,
Just like oxygen, in the air.
The way we live it, is up to us,
With a negative or with a plus.

Life is something, we should cherish,
We never know, when we'll perish.
Live each and every single day,
Smell the flowers, stop and play.

Life is something, we've been blessed,
Choice is yours, choose your quest.
Follow your passions, and you'll be fine,
With the right attitude, you will shine.


Paint Your Life

Life is like a piece of art,
It requires lots of heart.
Choose your paint and your brush,
Take your time, avoid the rush.

Before you paint, choose your theme,
Don't be afraid, to follow your dream.
It's alright, to make a mistake.
Your painting is real, it's not fake.

Look at your painting, don't be crying,
Begin again, keep on trying.
Your painting is never fully complete,
Enjoy the process, make sure it's sweet.


Live Life To The Fullest

To Follow your heart, and intuition,
That should be, your number one mission.
Listen to your inner voice,
Live your life, through your choice.

The point is to love, what you are doing,
Your deepest passions; should be pursuing.
Every moment, live excited,
Every morning, be delighted.

Always look forward, to what is ahead,
Your thoughts and wisdom, gracefully spread.
Living life to the fullest, is up to you,
Look in the mirror, always be true.


Life's Too Short

Life's too short, to simply waste,
Slow it down, don't move with haste.
Time is once, you get to spend,
Carefully choose, every friend.

Life's too short, to change careers,
Choice is yours, they're your years.
Maybe once, or maybe twice,
Look inside, to find advice.

Life's too short, to just complain,
Rid negativity from your brain.
Life's too short, time won't freeze,
Enjoy it all, won't you please.


Life and Love

Life and love share a bond,
Not through magic, nor a wand.
Each of us, both we need,
Nurture them, like a garden seed.

Life with no love, substance lacks,
To each soul, a heavy tax.
Love with no life, slowly fades,
It may take a few decades.

Life and love, has so much beauty,
We must enjoy them, that's our duty.
Open our hearts, and freely share,
Life and love, will be very fair.


I Love Life

Our life, we may shape and mould,
It's more precious, than all the gold.
As we wake, there's a shine,
From our sun, the day is fine.

With our family, life we share,
They love us back, they truly care.
We are never, ever alone,
We are people, we're not stone.

I love life, for the little things,
When a little child sings.
Abundant joy, we may create,
I love life, it's truly great!


My Life

My precious life, I live each day,
I work so hard, and try to play.
A simple, meaningful, conversation,
Leads to joy, and true sensation.

Occasionally confronted, with a struggle,
Countless emotions, simultaneously juggle.
Sometimes I win, sometimes I fail,
No matter what, there's always a tale.

From my life, I'll never hide,
Loving the journey, with every stride.
Wherever I go, one thing I'll take,
Smile of joy, each day that I wake.


It Takes Courage

It takes strength to be firm,
It takes courage to be gentle.

It takes strength to conquer,
It takes courage to surrender.

It takes strength to be certain,
It takes courage to have doubt.

It takes strength to fit in,
It takes courage to stand out.

It takes strength to feel a friend's pain,
It takes courage to feel your own pain.

It takes strength to endure abuse,
It takes courage to stop it.

It takes strength to stand alone,
It takes courage to lean on another.

It takes strength to love,
It takes courage to be loved.

It takes strength to survive,
It takes courage to live.


Sadness

Life may bring sorrow and grief,
Sometimes it's just unfairly brief.
Daily struggles, and even pain,
Body, mind, constant drain.

Dealing with an angry boss,
What about untimely loss.
Nobody deserves, to live in fear,
It has been a sad filled year!

Simple words, often hurt,
All this sadness, could we invert?
This has been the steepest slope,
Nothing left, only hope.


Struggles in My Life

Struggles in life may include many,
Losing everything, not having a penny.
Sometimes our hearts, feel empty and alone,
Anxiety takes over, depression prone.

We learn to deal with our emotional scars,
Forgive others, and reach for the stars.
What about anger and frustration?
Adversity helps us, deal with temptation.

Sometimes in life, we struggle and suffer,
Those experiences, make us much tougher.
Struggles teach us, more than words could say,
They help make us, the individuals, we are today.


Journey of Life

Journey of life, an interesting book,
Don't be shy, go take a look.
Each book contains, stories unique,
Listen to others, they'll reveal as they speak.

Some books are short, others are long,
Each to his own; book does belong.
Listen more carefully, and you will learn,
The respect of storytellers, definitely earn.

Only book to critique, is solely your own,
But instead, be proud how it grown.
Journey of life, and interesting book,
Allow others, to take a good look.


Life is Beautiful

Life is beautiful, we all know,
In the summer and in the snow.
So many things to learn and see,
We are equals, we are free.

Life is beautiful, we all know,
Younger ones, we teach and we show.
Life is filled with satisfaction,
There is always, a cool distraction.

Life is beautiful, we all know,
Relax, and go with the flow,
Degree of beauty, depends on the eyes,
What do you see, when you look at the skies?


Teenage Life

Life as a teenager, may sometimes be hard,
So many obstacles, keep up your guard.
Not sure, who's your true friend,
Or whether you're following, the latest trend.

Well, here's a little bit of advice,
Be true to yourself, and always be nice.
Always stand up, for what you believe,
If there's a fight, be smarter and leave.

Share your thoughts, with others at school.
Similar minds you will definitely find,
Be yourself, generous and kind.
