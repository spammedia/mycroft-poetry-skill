Do Less

Do less thinking,
And pay more attention to your heart
Do less acquiring,
And pay more attention to what you already have

Do less complaining,
And pay more attention to giving
Do less controlling,
And pay more attention to letting go

Do less criticizing,
And pay more attention to complimenting
Do less arguing,
And pay more attention to forgiveness

Do less running around,
And pay more attention to stillness
Do less talking,
And pay more attention to silence.



Soul Of Light

I look behind and after
And find that all is right,
In my deepest sorrows
There is a soul of light.



Success is Counted Sweetest

Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple Host
Who took the Flag today
Can tell the definition
So clear of Victory

As he defeated-dying
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Burst agonized and clear!


Be the Best You

We are perfectly imperfect
and beautiful within
because beauty isn�t skin deep
it�s deeper than the skin

We are who we allow ourselves to become
we get what we give, we give what we get
so give it your all
and don�t ever give up

Be the best you
be the person you want to be
just remember to be yourself
not who others want to see

This day is yours
it belongs to no one but you
put one foot in front of the other
and take a step closer
to making all your dreams come true

You are perfectly imperfect
and this is okay
because no one is flawless
no one is perfectly made

You are beautiful within
and your smile reflects
the love inside your heart
So, share a grin
and let others see who you are

Be the best you
just be who you are inside
be the person that makes you happy
and live your best life


You Can Do Anything

There�s a mountain before you
One you feel you can never climb
The distance is frightening,
but I know you can make it to the other side
If only you try

I�ve seen the strength
that you carry inside
I�ve seen the will, the passion
the fight in your eyes
I�ve witnessed your ambition
I know you can do it one more time

You can do anything
You can be anyone
You can be happy, too
But first you must believe
in the power of you

You�re powerful,
valuable, beautiful and brave
And I know that you know
you can make it through tomorrow
if you can get through today;
I will be there for you
every step of the way


Magic in You

Don�t ever give up on
what�s in your heart
Don�t ever let go of
What it is you believe in
Don�t ever say the road is too tough
And that it�s better to quit

Don�t ever think that you don�t matter;
Because you�re important to me
Don�t ever let anyone tell you
That you can�t follow your dreams

Don�t ever think that the world
Doesn�t need someone like you;
You�ve touched my heart and my life
Just by being who you are
And the things you do.

There�s a magic in you
That no other could possess.
A quality, a warmth, a sparkle
That will carry you through life�s tests

There�s a magic in you
That makes you special to me.


Be True to You

As you set out on life�s road
unsure of the path you�ll go,
the most important thing you can do
is to always be true to �you�

Always remember who you are
in moments of struggle or fear.
Never forget or give up on
the hopes and dreams you hold dear

There will be setbacks and rejection
and moments of failure too,
but you must overcome any frustration
to achieve the potential of you.

Don�t forget to smile, or laugh,
or to live in the present;
no matter where life takes you
make every memory pleasant.

As you travel along your journey,
know that you�re never alone
and I�ll always be here for you
should you need the comfort of home.
