True Friends

Best friends stick together till the end,
They are like a straight line that will not bend.

They trust each other forever,
No matter if you're apart you are together.

They can be your hero and save the day,
They will never leave your side they are here to stay.

They help you up when you fall,
Your true friends are best of all.


True Friendship

True friends are for life
Until the end
They're more than special
They're your bestest friends.

They're the ones you can go to
When you're in despair
The ones that'll help you
Even when you got gum in your hair!

They're the ones who'll laugh
And go laughing with you all through the night
The ones who'll help you
Help you with all their might

To have a good friend
You have to be one
So be nice to one another
So you can be friends forever
And that's how to be the best friend you can be.
