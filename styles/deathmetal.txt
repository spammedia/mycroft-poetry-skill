Come forth demonized
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
In the battle sky we lie estranged
Kings of the ravenrealm

We trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
Viewing myriad battles
Yet our eyes sparkling strident with strength

To trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
The ones to sit upon the elder throne
With shadowed faces for the coming centuries

Riding towards the masterfields
A ride from the North to the North
By our sacred ravens we are one
In the deadwhite moonlight

THE NORTHWIND AND THE FULLMOON KNELL
ORDAIN THE TRIUMPH OF SALVATION
TO SKOLL THE SUN TO MURDER THE WORLD
AND TO FENRIS THE EARTH TO QUELL

INTO ENDLESS DARKNESS ENTHRALL
UNDER FIMBULWINTER'S SPELL

SPECTRAL GLIMMER OF GLACIAL SNOW
THE LUCID CLOAK OF BARBARIC WINTER
NEARING CRUEL EYES WITHIN THE GALE
IN THE DAWN OF A FROZEN KINGDOM

INTO ENDLESS DARKNESS ENTHRALL
UNDER FIMBULWINTER'S SPELL

AT THE END OF WARWOLVES' TRAIL
THE THRONE OF THE FROZEN KINGDOM
HOLOCAUST OF FALLEN CHARIOTS
A NEW REIGN

Far above is we reign mercilessly
Kings of the ravenrealm
Stronger than ice, stronger than stone
A horde of heathenhearts to come

Battles, battles in the North
Battles, battles in the North

Those who adhere to principle above battle lust
Sing your songs with dying breath

Come forth demonized
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
In the battle sky we lie estranged
Kings of the raven realm

A black and white moving cloud of wings in the sky
A flock of vultures approach while blotting out the sun
Their shrieks are deafening
To the human ears
Of those who died, all return...

Feel the hoofs - they're coming
Hear the growls - they're coming
Fallen prey now hunt their hunter
Vengeance of the animal beast

See their numbers - they're coming
Smell their stench - they're coming
Slaughtered victims now slay their master
Retaliation of the beast

Nations are trampled under four legged flesh
A pounding horde of hollow bodies in sight
They rear their skulls and cry out
Of all those who were killed, all return

Echoes of swine squeals distorting the silence
Reclaiming the loss of meat stolen from their bodies
Chewing and pissing on human remains
Of all those who were slain, all return

Moans and barks coming from the same direction
The human's pets no longer sit at their sides
Primitive instincts, animalistic dogma
Of all those in captivity, now in devious activity

Species without a language of words
Known only for their deeds
A call upon death, death answers quickly
Of all those who're alive, not an animal - not a man

Massive human emibration
Massive death inhabitation

We trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
Seeing myriad battles
Yet our eyes sparkling strident with strength
We trample…

Those who adhere to principle above battle lust
Sing your songs with dying breath

For the Kings of the Raven Realms!
Battles, battles in the North
Battles, battles in the North

Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystallized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths
To follow

Painted faces
From earlier centuries
Wander by desecrating winds
Blinded shadows
Cast out from daylight
And from the beaten lands

Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystallized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths to follow

Enjoying the circling of eminent silence
Amidst the glacial abyss
Join my yearning emptiness
The knowing of being beneath
Grim and frostbitten kingdoms

Standing in ringwalls of stone
Deepest dungeons
Pass iron gates
Nor the golden sent dreams

Under towers
That once stormed in sight
That never storm

What a perfect sight to see
Decomposed dead bitch
I spread her buttocks wide and I love what I see
Anus covered with worms
I masturbate as I fingerfuck
Slimy rectum, full of rot and shit
Maggots crawling, insects feasting
I squirt my load allover her ass

Kill them, for they must die
Mongers of the greatest lie
Burn them, for (the) sins they scar
Followers not leaders in war
Left to rot is their faith on poles
Icons shatter with burning holes
Curtains fall on religion's role
The cancer of the soul

Hallowed name, holy trinity
With disdain now crush this divinity
Preaching tongues, lizard spawned
Recycle the Christian death from (the) beyond
House of God, pit of snakes
Staring through the eyes of mistakes
In their hearts, oh they carry fear
Succumb to death and make it disappear

Casket cracks, (with) human debris
Death in the last degree
Salvation's not, to be seen
Faith is lost in the blood-red scream
Repeating God's, name in vain
The mantra of your life's pain
Body cracks, (with) vivisection
Salvation's now a dead infection

Rising from the darkside
Arriving from beyond
The lord of death approaches
To end all human lives

The pleasure of the torment
Will bring him back to Earth
The time has come for closure
The final hour calls

But there's a way out of the misery
You can join the massacre
Once you're in you're never out
A soldier of the dead forevermore

There's eternity for sale
In the Brave New Hell
You will join here and dwell
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
None can stop the rising
Of the Brave New Hell
You will come alive
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)

Your death for life eternal
Is no high price to play
You'll get more strength
From every single human that you slay

The night of devastation
The final holocaust
Bring on the armageddon
Only death remains

Now... that all his enemies have ceased
It's time for the final feast
Tear the flesh of the remains of mankind
The rebirth of Hell on Earth

Behold... eternal eclipse!
Humanity fades away
The creatures bond to black
Will turn color into grey

Hill
To the elder ravens
On Bergs laid in fog
Forget not the blasphemic
North deeps

Shadows steal our souls
Into what we once were
I’m feeling they’re taking us there

We summon thee oh mighty one
Master can you hear our calls
We'll die for you oh lord of death
We await the day when the curtain of night
Will fall and never rise
The dead shall rise again
Pleasure turn to pain
The Ascension
Nothing will survive
Hell shall come alive
The Ascension

Demise, the sun is dying in the sky
The ground is shaking, the end is near
All the restless souls
From the universe below will rise again
Let the eternal misery begin

Ressurection Through Carnage
Breeding Death
In eternal darkness
Death shall live forevermore

Closed in time
For those who shall not pass our gates

In circles concentric against the Earth
I enthrone my spiritworlds
Obviously of frost shall be
Blizzard beasts encompassing me
To vipe the faces of the Earth
In memorial to the ones with pride
Glance of day shall never shine
These realms are mine

Master of nebulah frost
Await the solar fall
Creations of ice shall behold
Wings majestic funereal
Guide through spectral lands
None shall pass me there

Hidden within churning chasms of an elder age
Come the mighty sons of dawn
Shadows of aurora
A time for pure holocaust to rise
Decades a thousand fold

In circles concentric against the Earth
I enthrone my spiritworlds
Obviously of frost shall be
Blizzard beasts encompassing me
To vipe the faces of the Earth
In memorial to the one with pride
And glance of day shall never shine
For these realms are mine

Still-breathing valleys
Made birth to the beasts
From the throne of the north
Throned by blackstorms

Creations of ice shall behold
Wings majestic funereal
Guide through spectral lands
None shall pass me there

Throned by blackstorms

Moonrise fields of sorrow
Our mighty fathers fell
Mountain watches memories
Dark shining past

Laid in frost below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the fathers of Norse men
And in us they shall return

Shine for me fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me never-ending snowfall

Moonrise fields of sorrow
Moonrise fields of sorrow

Shine for me fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me never-ending snowfall

Laid in frost below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the fathers of Norse men
And in us they shall return
Begun to me never-ending snowfall

Eyeless in eternal time
For I’ve worn the moonshine
Burning away the daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Winds will come to me
Descending now
Towards the frost moon eclipse

A spectral spirit kingdom rises
In storm screens covered by ice
Night emits its shadow
And there’s no difference between ravens
They have come for me
They will come to me
To the cursed realms of the winterdemons

Lavender eyes had only known the under dark
From the crypts of stone they ride beyond the blinding glare

Eyeless in eternal time
For I’ve worn the moonshine
Burning away the daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Winds will come to me
Descending now towards
The frostmoon eclipse

Out from the chambers
The horizon will be open for me
To the face of the Earth will know this black silence
For I saw them march
For the lights

Endless tall mountainside
Gates to open wide
Lands of dragon birth
Sorrow always rain

On a frosty path to sorrow
Guarded by unearthly beasts
Darkening memories claim
That winter never dies

Bad moons enshrined
In the heart
Northern Darkness
Walk with me hand in hand

On a frosty path to sorrow
Guarded by unearthly beasts
Darkening memories claim
That winter never dies

With bad moons enshrined in the heart
Northern darkness walks
With me hand in hand

Endless tall mountainside
Gates to open wide
Land of dragonbirths
Sorrow always rain

What wait eternity in Permafrost
Views that eyes can never bear
At the stormy gates of mist
I’m still standing

In storm I ride towards shadow ruins
Infernally vasts take my sight
Took color my vision
From an endless dripping sky

Paint the visage centuries old
Of those that ride by my side
The hovering steel desecrators

Nearer have I never been
To this I always searched
Crystal-clear opening
In which I shall be gone

From an endless dripping sky
Cryptic visages centuries old
Of those that rode by my side

In storm I stand upon the ruins
Infernally vasts take my sight again
The light is dim before me
For vision was frost
For vision was frost

Chiming bells of immortality
Sing through the halls of eternity

In time when dragons sprang out from the Earth
I was at one with a blackening moonlit
And from a Berg to the open sky
I saw a raven circle

Born out of thorns to the surface world
Mesmerizing strength
To fly among the blackest rain
And soar into the deepest gorge

For this I would battle kingly palaces
For they learn to be false
And outshine it all that I once knew

Circling above the open sky
To fly among the blackest rain
In the under dark
To soar into the deepest gorge

In time when dragons sprang out from the Earth
I was at one with a blackening moonlit
From a Berg to the open sky
I saw a raven circle

Circling…
Circling above in time before time

far above the ravengate
The spread wings of Blashyrkh wait
Above the roaring depths
Sits the oath of frost on the elder Raven Throne

Older mountains sleeping in my sight
By chilling woods I stand
A grimly sound of naked winds
Is all that it shall ever be heard from here

In darkest times when evil ruled
Salvation out of sight
Three wise men had seen the sign
To end eternal night

Life... Awaiting signs from the one
Death... The very essence of fear
Find... They're on a quest for the place
Where... The son of God will rise

Stillborn Savior
Prayers in vain
Stillborn Savior
Now he will return

The prophecies were only lies
Hell moves into paradise
All your prayers weren't worth much
He was denied his birth

The ancient Gods reclaim the Earth
And chaos reigns supreme
The reaper took the heaven sent
And ended life serene

Nothing can free the world
Forever captured in the dark
Nothing can save the Earth
The creatures of the dead will arise
Feasting upon mankind
Humanity is soon extinct
Desolation soon complete
The darkest one has been enthroned

Infernal death, a world in flames
No humans stand a chance
The pure ones fell into the abyss
On dead angels demons dance

Hell is here
A force you can't defeat
Born from fear
Betrayal and deceit

Mutilated For Sexual Purposes
I cut off her arms and legs
Blood spills from the stumps
Ripping out her guts makes me horny
I stuck my cock in her mouth
I saw off the head and cum
Anal double fistfuck
The bitch is done

Blashyrkh
Cometh the rightful Kings of the highest halls
Cry of ravens lurk the realm
Eternally through the noctambulant grimness

Surgical exposure
Embalmed in blood and unaware
Your heart collapsing in the wake
Your eyes are frozen in a stare

Imprisonment in flesh
Deadened body holding cell
Neurobiosis cuts the way on through
Rotting soul condemned to Hell

I cut away
Sculpture death
Carve in your thoughts
Bloodspray
Parasite breath
Breed is the cause
Violate
Desecrate
Sever the spine
I dissect
So perfect
Muscles that bind

Flames, wildfire
As far as the eye can see
Purging inferno catastrophy
Waves, highwater
At the places it shouldn't be
Sweeping, whirlpool insanity

World downfall, the fury and the chaos within
Ambushment, attack from within the Earth

Come forth defiled one
Command the swarming of flies
Let us pray
The womb of darkness will soon give birth

Contagious dysphoria
Asleep in rotten demise
Malediction awakes the ones absorbed by earth

Carve me up, slice me apart
Suck my guts, lick my heart
Chop me up I like to be hurt
Drink my marrow and blood for dessert
EATEN... My one desire, my only wish is to be--
EATEN... The longer I live the more I'm dying to feel the pain
EATEN... I would do anything to be--
EATEN... My one desire, my only wish is to be--
EATEN...

He is hater of the rotten Earth
He is the nova that will drape the sky in woe
We drink from his poisoned water
He is lord of those who dwell bound in sickness
Spitting vomit in the face of faith
Cleansing us who must atone for being weak
We drink from his poisoned water
He is the shadow cast upon those defiled

Victorious call
It will not befall
No salvation is free
Death comes beckoning thee
Encircle thee
Voices come in wind
Son of perdition
You come beckoning me

The sky embedded in the death of a nova
Effigy is seen in a second of light
No voice in the crack of his mouth
Bastard son of God

Last night I had the most exciting dream
In it I was surrounded by many asses
I got shitted allover
Diarrhea splattered from every direction
I felt like I was in heaven
My cock ejaculated biggest load of cum I had ever seen
Suddenly I woke up, it was only a dream
But why was I covered with diarrhea?


Born without arms and legs
She is just a circus freak
Stupid fucking whore
She is a cheap piece of meat
Now she must suffer
Brutally beaten into the head
Fingerfucked anus, knife in a pussy
Lifeless torso gangraped and gutted
Snuffed in front of a camera
All taped in one take, nothing is fake
Sold as porn in 666 postages

Few days ago I bought a cat
It is so cute, I want to fuck it hard
Walking on four legs, shaking that little ass
Dirty fucking slut who deserves to suffer
I place my cock in the center of tis asshole
Hard push, damn its tight but feels so good
I fuck like a rabbid, cat screams in agony
Faster adn faster, cat is unconscious
I cut off its tail and shove it up my ass
Innards ripped out, head cut off, cat is fucked up
Squirting my sperm allover the mess
Tomorrow Im gonna buy a dog

My face shows no emotion
The mind of an animal
Behind human eyes
Restrained with a rope
Crudely tied to wrists and ankles
Eyes jellied from chemical injections
Devoid of all compassion
I place no value on human life
Body temperature drops rapidly
But death comes slow
Post-mortal muscle reflexes - repeatedly choked

Your torture brings me pleasure
I climax as I murder
A mass of empty flesh, chosen to die brutally
Not one has survived - my torture and abuse
Unbearable pain and cruelty
Hatred for all fucking life

Abducted, beaten and murdered
A slow, cold-blooded death
Bones have been boiled
And removed of all flesh
Your torture brings me pleasure
I climax as I murder

Tortured until your death
Loss of blood drains from you now
Out leaks the human soul

My face shows no emotion
The mind of an animal
Behind human eyes
Devoid of all compassion
I place no value on human life
Body temperature drops rapidly - but death comes slow
Post-mortal muscle reflexes - repeatedly choked

Sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect
A warm glow inside my bones
The touch of velvet rubbed against my soul
Thoughts of things you've always known
Thoughts of things you've always known
Break through and listen, to yourself
To your Self

Let go of perception - enter true reality
I can see through my third eye...
Sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect
A warm glow inside my bones
The touch of velvet rubbed against my soul
Thoughts of things you've always known
Thoughts of things you've always known
Break through and listen, to yourself
To your Self

Let go of perception - enter true reality
A sea of green will set us free
Dank
Expand my inner being
Through what the Earth provides
I hear her voice aliing
The hour has arrived...

Sit back and hold your breath, just let nature take effect
A warm glow inside my bones
The touch of velvet rubbed against my soul
Thoughts of things you've always known
Thoughts of things you've always known
Break through and listen, to yourself
To your Self

Those nightmares still keep me awake
I wish that I could just sleep
And when I open my eyes
Somehow I don't feel the same
Those visions tell me to kill
Fight my thoughts - my own thoughts
I can't tell wrong from right
They break me down - they break me down
I'm slipping away
Those visions tell me to kill
Night visions
Those visions tell me to kill
Night visions
Those nightmares still keep me awake
I wish that I could just sleep
And when I open my eyes
Somehow I don't feel the same
Fight my thoughts - my own thoughts
I can't tell wrong from right
They break me down - they break me down
I'm slipping away
Kill me before I wake

Back again to kill and gut
I crave intestine
Fist-fucked reduced to a stump
Kill - all
From life it sets all free
Indulged in killing spree
Disguised as the one to be
Draped in disease
Medication set aside
No cure here to confide
In your veins it then shall hide
Draped in disease

Subterranean growth maligned
Abomination the kind
Balterium lord of twisted mass
Eyeless but not blind

Feasting the excrements
Of a thousand infections severe
Crawling as a snake
In the spreading epidemic lair

Down the fluid hell
Stained are the walls with its poisoned breath
Roots of pestilent plague
The rates abide its ways as a tail of death

Down the hive of chills
From the filth of mankind it now feeds

Speaking by the name of seti
The effigy speaks through a mask made of human skin
Godless fallen soul impaled
A name might be upon you before we will let you in
I believe, bloodshed in the name of sorrow
Stone is cast for the enemy to walk in harms way
We will make him burn and burn again
Lost in the vortex he is gone no blessing underway

Melting thoughts of disintegration
Hitting deep her insistance
to mutilate her newborn infants
After giving birth her mind wasn't the same
Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay
Family now complete
Father watches on
As mother dismembers
her newborn son

Dissecting the specimen, split
I will explore, the body wide open
Uncover carnage within, split wide open
Virgin, untouched skin
Releasing her rage
That dwells inside
tainted blood rushes through veins
her body chemically changed
Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife

The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse
every nine months she butchers one more child
Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home

Bones and skulls of sons and daughters
Genitals ferment
In jars inside the cupboards
for father to dissect
No one will discover the murder they commit

Children used like laboratory rats
Sickening vulgar experiments
She sees what others can't
Probing the guts of her fetus
Advocation of the pain
Mutilating, draining veins

Witness the horror
offering to themselves
Continuing murdering their own kind
Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy
Addiction to this heightened state
Post-birth psychosis
disjointing her own children
form the life they'll never live
A massacre within her soul
Struggling for control

I was once a man before I transformed
into this molester, freshly deceased children
You have born, torn by my rape
The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse
I will violate

Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction
I open the coffin
Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
At the dead, over and over, I can't escape
I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice
I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy
for nine days straight I do the same
She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave
her neck I hack, cutting through the back
I use her mouth to eject

Here I cum, blood gushes from
bleeding black blood
her head disconnected
As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein
She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head
My lubrication, her decomposition
Spending my life molesting dead children

Intercourse with infants
Curing heads on top of spikes
boiling skulls
Skin sliding off of bones

Voices
The voices call
Voices
The voices are calling me
Buried dead I've spiritually infected
Call to me from beyond their graves

Bleed
I now bleed pus
I bleed, the blood of the dead
I bleed on her livid skin
Thrusting myself within
Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
Beyond what we know as death
It haunts me everyday
I hear the voice of every child
That lies next to me decayed
A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection
Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled

Violated after death
Virgin hole I infest
Anal pore spewing cess
The sacred juice I injest
Your dead child I defile
Necropedophile

Digging up her corpse, she is worm infested
Badly decomposed, but I take her to my home
Stench of rot turns me on and my cock grows rapidly
I am so horny, I need to fuck that dirty whore
I put my cock in her mouth, bitch gives rotted head
It feels so good, I slap her pus-filled face
Now its time to give her something
Tonguefucking putrefying cunt
The taste is incredible, much better than the one that is alive
I eat maggots from her pussy
I turn her over and start to fuck like a mad dog
Deeper and harder, I am about to go crazy
Now its time to penetrate ass
Her asshole is so tight, this must be her first time
Faster and faster, I can feel my balls banging against her cunt
I quickly cum, squirting inside rectum
Pulling my cock out, its covered with with sperm, shit and insects
Fucking stupid bitch, your ass was dirty, you fucking dead slut
I brutally smash my fist up her cunt and rip her entrails out
Double fistfucking her asshole
Chainsaw mutilation, she is now in pieces
I put all parts in plastic bags and drive back to cemetary
One by one I throw bags down her grave
No time to bury her again, fuck you whore

Coming of flood
Sickening god
Bring him to me
Torrent of blood

Rid us the disease of mankind
Unseen is he who will ultimately control the gift
Blocking out the sun
Our chains eroded we are finally set adrift

Skinless body
Naked hanging
Blood as draining
Carving, killing
Swollen beauty
Holes appearing
Brutalizing, convulsing
Skinned and greasy
Still breathing
Anal carving
Holes are oozing
Slit your throat - deep
Off cane your head
Pulled out the guts
Right through your fucking neck!

Don't think I give a fuck about your life or religion
I don't fucking care about the world you fucking live in

Injecting bleach into your eyes - body starts to quiver
Spilled your guts onto the flor - consume the fecal dralnage

Liver withered - appendix punctured, pancreatic explosion
Knife scraping spinal bone
Like nalls on a chalk board

The pigs the want to lock me up
But the still don't know who I am
I leave a trall of blood and guts - cold Impulse to disembowel

And the end begins
Slaughter
Time of humans end
Terminated
Enter bowls of hell
Curl up and die
Cowarding - controlled

You are nothing
You will fear thee
Pleague of zombies
Curse of the living

Lost a world of pleasure
Now here comes the torture
Murderers and killers
Once your friends
And neighbours

Rising from the grave
Writhing in pain
I want to eat your brain
We're rising from the grave

Burning fires
Homes and cities
Torn to shit from
War and poverty
Overcrowding led to killing
Decaying bodies left unburied
Crimson famine kept on spreading
Breeding Ignorance
Declining populace
The day the dead walked
Apocalypse
The day the dead walked
The armageddon
The day the dead walked
Apocalypse
The day the dead walked

Rising from the grave
Writhing in pain
I want to eat your brain
We're rising from the grave

Salvation - is a crippled bitch
Satisfaction - from murdering
Evil voices - made me do it
The devil - made me want it
The Priest - he had to die
So did that family of five
No way to stop what you cannot find
No way to kill - it never dies

Push me too far - I might just snap
Blood shot ice - and a knife in my hand
Pissed off - at society
Sick of them - looking down at me
So I went - to school with a loaded uzi
And I made sure - that no one survived
No way to stop what you cannot find
No way to kill - it never dies

EVIL
It never dies
It's in us
EVIL

It's all fucked up
Let's fuck it up
The murderers, the murderers will find you
Try to hide you'll bleed long and die slow
Murderers are strong we kill in numbers
On a machete attack, a machete attack
Taught to kill to kill and kill again - your
Cornered like a trapped rat in the pen - now
I'll watch you die - no, it doesn't bother me see
I just laugh and spit in the face of the enemy
KILL
We come to kill tonight we come to kill you
In everyway the grim death has now found you
Burn, burn try to burn yourself to escape us
Find your carred body, cut your throat and drink your hot blood
Across the planet a shadow has eclipsed us
Death seeks the light and then it just engulfs it
Like a pig feeding off it's own shit, sick!

Rip through a world of ignorance, destroy the incompetents
Suffocate the ones against
An unnatural death - that's what they should expect
A painful end
Well just take it back, on a machete attack
The Murderers
I live to kill, I'm plotting deaths like a terrorist
On our way to the next place to murder at
Attack the unsuspecting like cattle in a slaughterhouse
Feed them with truth
Fattened-up for the kill

Fear of dying
Unknown ending
Bloody - coagulating
Out through yur hollow bones
Emptied of your weakened soul
Pus ejected out the pores
Hatched chopped her into bits
Playing with her severed tits
Sucking out the bloodied milk
Waiting for decay waiting

Strapped to the table
My tools are sharpened

Never-ending violent killings
Young and helpless
Unborn tortured - knives stuck in her
Cut up and fucked

Cold inside
Blood explodes from every hole

I hear you now screaming
My work just beginning
waiting for decay

Out of leg twitching
But the body's not moving

Those I hunt are
Rotting in the grave and
Crippled and broken
Weeks left decaying
Dead unburried
I open up the coffin
No it don't disgust me
It gets me hard

I ejaculate - on the corpse
Another whore to torture and butcher
To molest after death
I'm just waiting for decay

I'll kill all the haters
They'll nerver stop their deaths
We'll bread and burn and murder
Each of you to the last
Return to make it final
One bullet to your head
I know it just won't happen
A world that's free from pain
So I'll just use my freedom
To fucking kill and maim them
Reduce their heads with lead
Not ever gonna stop us
Not 'til the last one drops off
Not 'til they die and rot up
Not ever gonna stop
Not 'til the last one drops

One bullet left - one bullet left - one
One bullet left - one life to die - one
One bullet left - one bullet left - one

For some reason you motherfuckers think this is
Some kind of motherfuckin game
You ain't gonna realize until I got some fucking
Steel pointed at your faggot-ass face and blow your
Motherfuckin dome off your goddamn shoulders
You motherfuckin critic-ass bitch motherfuckers
Catch you comin out your motherfuckin house
Bleed!

I put the gat to your face and head and blast
Blow your fuckin face off, rock you with the
Sawed-off, blow guts all over your bitch
Leave your stankin in a six foot ditch
Run up in your house with a tek out
Duct tape your spouse with a gun in her mouth
Smack your dids up you think I give a fuck
I'll call the fuckin pigs on myself
Barricade the black with the ATF
I don't give a fuck bitch I pray for death
Grab your little girl by the neck
Bust her in the chest
And throw her on the lawn
Call CNN it's on, get this on TV
The last one's for me
Aim with the pipe down dead in my head
And squeeze
Leave the whole wall red

One bullet left, one bullet left - one
One bullet left - one life to die for
One bullet left, one bullet left - one
One bullet left - one life to die for

Always got one bullet left
One of fifty to their fucking chests

Time again to die a slow death
Now take that last breath
Sounds of bones crack
Better make your way to the exit real fast
I'll escape my thoughts of pain, through death
Pull the trigger the gun's put to your head
Flash a white light before you die
A murder made to look like a suicide

Knife through your gut
Now die you fucking slut
Punctured lung, a gouged out throat
I hope in hell you fucking rot
Suicide or was it murder?

Open wide and eat my shit How's it taste you little bitch?
Die by knife, gun or axe
Ripped to shreds - shot, cut in half

I spit on your bones
Piss in the hole in your head
Suicide or was it murder?

Cut off your faces
Turned your back - now breaking
Eyes long blind - shut, stabbed out
Burn in hell and fucking rot

Knife to the gut
Gun to the head
Axe to the neck
Dead

Crawling - roaches
From
Rotten
Orifices
Worms
Sliding
Feeding
Eating
Snakes

Severed ead - eyes gouged out
Knife jammed in your ass
Shotgun in your mouth
A thousand ways to kill
and I'd like to try them out
A rope around your neck
Or a razor through your wrist

It's all about to end - all
Soon you'll all be dead - all

Operation slow vivisection
Inner organs now removed from
Emptied ribcage, head smashed open
Deseased brain probed
Eyes wide open

It's all about to end - all
Soon you'll all be dead - all

I'll be your victim
Come on fuck me up
It won't be easy
We'll see if you can cut me up
Sick and Twisted
Let's fight a real fight
Let's duel until the death
I love the taste of blood that feeling of a dying breath
Sick and Twisted
I'll be your victim
Come on count me in
I cant't wait to fell the pain
It's something I believe in

Your blood runs down my face
Now your guts drool out my mouth
Try to scream your tongue's cut out
Heart tries to beat but blood's run out

It's all about to end - all
Soon you'll all be dead - all

Severed head - eyes gouged out
Knife jammed in your ass
Shotgun in your mouth
A thousand ways to kill
and I'd like to try them out
On you

Cadaver Multilator, cadaver butchery
A love for truth of flesh
A love for purity
Purity of flesh now torn - torn from your live reborn
Mortal extermination
To kill repeatedly - your will not be found at all

Vomit spews from your mouth reeking of desease
And piss
Shit ran down - your leg at death
Taste the rot of human life, breathe
The stench of decayed blood
Missing teeth and lower jaws
Losing half

A foot and arm
Joined together different victims
Kiiping bones and human flesh
Frozen head and eyes on ice
Cutting off an ear to eat
Hoarding all the body parts
Genitals are cut from you
Rearranging human beings

Cadaver mutilator, cadaver butchery
A love for truth of flesh
A love for purity
Purity of flesh now torn -
torn from your life reborn
Mortal extermination
To kill repeatedly -
&nsbp;you will not be found at all

Missing toes and several fingers
Foot and ankle joined together
Arms cut off and shoved into cunts
Jacked off at the hips
Nose sewn to an upper leg
Lips used to masturbate
Kill the next I see - freeze their injuries
Dismantling a human being
Reattach a frozen head
To another's rotten neck - turning
From the blood it lacks
I can smell the pain of death
I will taste the bleeding dead
Cadaver mutilator, cadaver butchery
Torn up all for my pleasure, torn up all for the meat
Cadaver mutilator, cadaver butchery
The body's sewn together
My work of art complete


I'm gonny poison the population
Gonna plan myself an assassination
On the hunt to kill again - I plan to butcher the planet
I'm like the cold hand of Death
Reaching out to snatch the next
And when I'm through with them
Motherfucker you're the next fucking victim

In this necrosociety
In my necrosociety
I'll turn you all into blood sucking freaks
Those who won't turn - Meat!
Feed to bleed to kill to live to die afraid
Of what I can do to you
The savior of mankind
The cause of world-wide homicide
Fall to your knees and pray to me
My knife will get you free
In this necrosociety
In my necrosociety
I'm gonna murder everyone on earth
And when your dead I'm gonna kill myself
Murder mankind murder mankind

I was visiting in africa two months ago
My goal was to see all those wild animals
Most excited I was when I came close to elephants
They were so big and somehow so scary
Something happened when I snapped a picture
Three elephants surrounded me
One of them ripped off all my clothes
Second elephant came on me and started to spread my buttocks
With its huge trunk
I screamed in agony when I felt it started to shove up my ass
Third elephant forced me to take its giant cock in my mouth
I sucked like a whore while I was assfucked by elephant trunk
After all it wasnt too bad at all
It took only about ten minutes and cock in my mouth started to cum
Extremely huge load of elephant sperm filled my throat and
Spurted allover my face
I was completely fucked up, but elephants had one more thing to do
All three of them huffed and puffed shits on me
Then they left me alone with my ripped asshole
I'll never go to Africa again


Wide open pussy in front of me
She wants me to fuck her hard
This time I want something different
I pull my out knife with rusty blade
Stabbing her vagina again and again
Blood sprays on my face, I feel I'm alive
More and more, her pussy is just a mess

Everyday I can hear voices in my head
They tell me to eat other humans and fuck their corpses
Im lurking in the shadows with my axe
Ready to murder and satisfy my sick hunger
I dont care if they are males or females
Older or younger, I kill and eat everybody
After my hunger is filled, I rape those mutilated corpses
I am one sick fuck and there is no stop for me
Now those voices tell me to eat myself
I slice my stomach open and rip out my guts
Feasting with my entrails, blood spills
I am one sick fuck and there is no stop for me

Demons searching for the chosen one
Angels killing, death has begun
Ruling horror close at hand
Son of Satan is in command

Death we're seeking for
Killing all in sight
Smashing through the boundaries
Marching through the night
Lusting in the evil
Sacrifice the life
Possessed in his power
Now prepare to die
Evil has arrived
Warrior of hell
Destructive aggressor
Your life he takes tonight

Death is forsaken
It has begun
Reign of terror
Satan's son
Total evil
Rips through his brain
As death flows free
Through his veins

Killing for life
He is bringing death
To the mortal scum
They will burn in hell

Evil they're seeking for
Divine is his power
Angel of destruction
Your lives he will take
War has driven
Forces to death
Holocaust on earth
Newborn die
The Anti-Christ
Rules the hellish sites of death

Killing for life you know you must die
All that you took,
Your death has arrived
The vision of destruction
Has done no harm
This powerful evil
Cause for alarm



Prepare yourself for the worst it's coming soon
I believe in those foretold prophecies of doom
They say the end is close, it's coming fast
Not every single one of us is gonna last
So, stand and fight or kill yourself right now
It'll be one less motherfucker to kill
Skin shot, burned, stabbed, scorched and torn
This pain is real - you can't ignore...

Arm yourself with the right to kill at will
Shoot to kill it's them or you
Time to choose, time to choose or die
Blood's pouring from the hole in your side
Take the pain - it'll focus and strengthen you
Take the pain - or your life's fuckin' through
Face the pain - let it become part of you
Take the pain
War is coming

Prepare yourself for the worst it's coming soon
I believe in those foretold prophecies of doom
They say the end is close, it's coming fast
Not every single one of us is gonna last
So, stand and fight or kill yourself right now
It'll be one less motherfucker to kill
Skinned, burned, stabbed, scorched and torn
This pain is real - you can't ignore...
War is coming

I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
We are the unborn - a child in the womb
Sheltered from the storm

I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
We are the unborn - a child in the womb
Sheltered from the storm

We just want the truth now
We just want to know

I'm gonna cut out my eyes
And rip out my tongue
I should just puncture my ears
I'm not alive now
We are the unborn - a child in the womb
Sheltered from the storm

We just want the truth
I'm gonna cut out your eyes
We just want the truth
And rip out your tongue
We just want to know.

A vicious lust for blood
I'll kill `til I die
Terrifying death
Horrifying hell
Nauseating screams
Screams that go unheard
Suffocate my soul
I'll take away your life
Commanding me to live
I sentence you to die.

Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole

Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity

The smell was unbearable
As I unburied her
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
down her throat, swallow
Eyes glassy and vacant
body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
tounguing her rotted anus

I need a live woman
to fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill
her body exceptional
she thought I was normal
but I wanted more

I came blood inside of her
chocking on the clot
gagging on the snot
gushing blood, from her mouth
bloody gel leaking out
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
To slit my own cock with a knife

Violent, climax
Serging serum
on my skin

Back from the dead
I am resurrected
to spew, putrefaction

I don't know
I just took that knife
And I cut her from her neck
Down to anus
And I cut out the vagina
And I ate it

A relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been

Cursed by the shamen
his voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs
go numb
I can't control my own thought
Are his now
his evil consuming me
ever telling me
begin the clit carving

Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
by the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat
their bleeding cunts will set me free
I can't control my own thought
I can't control my own thoughts
Warmth seeping from this
Body
Rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass

I feel more alive
more alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within

My mouth drools
As I slice your perinium
My body smeared
With the guts I've extracted
through her hole, came swollen organs
cunnilingus with the mutilated

My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
but I felt more real
when I was dead

The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit, the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice

Between the legs, I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her blood

There's something inside me
It's, it's coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose of the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold

Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me

Lifeless body, slouching dead
Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head

Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half

Crushing, cranial, contents

Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

Suffer, and then you die
Torture, pulverized

At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me

Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue

Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
