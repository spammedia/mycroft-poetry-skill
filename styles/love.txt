Peaceful Love

There is peace in my soul
For such a long awaited time
There is love in my life
A love of melody and rhyme.

Once you took hold of my heart
I knew no other could have reached
As whispered fate took my hand
To levels only you could reach.

You in my life
Will live eternally
I knew the first night we met
You were meant for me.


Magic of Love

My dear sweetheart,
It is you that I love
Under the stars above
Truly, with all my heart.

My dreams of you
Are dreams of Joy
Passion burns like a fire,
You're my only desire.

This magic that we feel
It tells me our love is real.
Right now and forever,
Our love will go on.


Star of Love

Billions of stars up in the sky,
One shines brighter, I can't deny ...
A love so precious, a love so true
A love that comes from me to you.

The angels sing when you are near,
Within your arms I have no fear.
You always know just what to say
Simply talking to you makes my day.

I love you honey with all of my heart
Together forever and never to part.

I love you with my heart
I love you with my soul
You make my being whole.


My Love My Life

I know what I had.
I know what I lost.
I know what I need.
I was blind and could not see,
What was right in front of me.

Guide me with your light,
Beautiful soul shining bright.
Now I can see
You are the only thing and everything I will ever need.
You are and forever will be.
My love, My life.

My Love is Pure

My love for you is pure, like the morning dew on a flower,
I feel it throbbing deep inside, with power.
My love is pure, like the first falling snow,
I sense its gentle touch streaming with a steady flow.
My love is pure, it is loyal,
oh, it will be eternal ...
And you I thank to make this normal.


Being With You

Being with you, close to you,
I feel so happy, so complete.
Hugging you in my arms, tender yet tight,
Kissing your lips so sweet,
Makes my entire life full and bright.

You are my better half, always in my heart
And I know I never want to be apart.
You are the true angel of my life.

I need to be with you forever ...
I will love you, ever and ever.


You Touched My Heart

Oh how you inspired this heart of mine,
with a touch so purely divine.

You're the one I always dreamed,
you're the light that can't be dimmed,
for my love is true, straight from my heart
and I know I will never let us go apart.


I Have Fallen In Love

I don't know how to say this,
the words walking through my mind.
I can't put pen to paper,
the sentence I can't find,
for the feelings deep inside my heart.
I pray to god above,
for the right words to tell you,
how much I have fallen in love.


Loving You

I'll be loving you
No matter what we go through
Come hail, sleet or snow
I'm not letting you go

Rich or poor, I guarantee
You'll always have me
Cause I'm so blessed to have you near
Each day, month and year

Only God above
Could have given this love
Though the toughest times
You've proven your mine
You're a wish come true
Ooh, I love loving you.


I Am Yours and You Are Mine

As I sit here and daydream
Of the first day we met
I can still see your eyes gleam
And I feel as if I won a bet
You're mine to keep
For now and forever.

I love you with all my heart,
Our love is so deep
It's as if we are a piece of art
So I'm yours and you are mine.
